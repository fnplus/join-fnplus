### About

I am a college freshman right now. I was interested computers since I was a kid, I used to play a lot of games and after that I started wondering how to make these games and from that moment I started travelling on this road. I took PCM with CS in my high School, back in school days I used to do any random stuff related to Computer, starting from rooting my android device to making some Graphic Designs. I am currently in the process of learning Machine Learning from Coursera courses and also focusing on python.
