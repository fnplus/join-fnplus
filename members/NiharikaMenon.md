# Niharika Menon
I am a Sophomore.I have always wanted to work in the field of Computer Science, and hence here I am. I am interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning and am finding my way through them. I am not an expert in the field and am looking for like minded people to learn with.

I yearn to work at Google or Microsoft someday, involving in their latest venture. Hope that day is not far away.
